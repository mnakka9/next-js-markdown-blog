# Little Red Riding Hood Summary

## Little Red Riding Hood is a fairy tale written by Charles Perrault. This is one of the world's best-known folk tales of European origin about a little girl who went to visit her ill grandmother and on her way met a big bad wolf who tried to eat her and her grandmother

Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a small village near the woods. She was the most beautiful little girl who was ever seen. Her mother loved her so much, but her grandmother loved her a little bit more. She made a little red riding hood for her granddaughter which made the little girl look even more beautiful, so everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.

One day, her mother asked her to go and check on her grandmother as she was old and sick and to bring her a little pot of butter and a cake.

The little girl loved her grandmother very much so she immediately went to visit her. She lived in another village on the other side of the woods so her mother told her to be careful and not to strain from the path or talk to strangers.

As she was walking through the woods, she came across a wolf, who wanted to eat her up but didn’t dare to, because he knew that there were some woodcutters cutting trees nearby and he was scared they would hear the little girl’s scream. The wolf asked Little Red Riding Hood where she was going and since she didn’t know how cruel the wolf's intentions were said she was going to see her grandmother and that her mother asked her to bring some cake and a little pot of butter.

The wolf asked if her grandmother lives far off and Little Red Riding Hood said she lives in the first house in the village beyond the mill he can see from there. Then the wolf said that he would also go and check on her to see if she was okay. He made a little contest and told her that she goes one way, while he goes the other way until they see who will be there first.

The wolf knew wood very well so he took the shortest path and ran as fast as he could while Little Red Riding Hood took a roundabout way. She didn’t mind as while she was heading to her grandmother’s house she ran with butterflies and entertained herself by gathering nuts and making flower bouquets. The wolf arrived at the grandmother’s house fast and knocked at the door.

Since the grandmother was good, she asked who was there and the wolf, counterfeiting his voice to sound like a little girl, said it was her grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought her a little pot of butter and a cake sent by her mother.

The grandmother was ill in bed, so she told the wolf, not knowing it was a wolf, to come in.

_"The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.""_

The wolf entered the house and immediately jumped on the old woman and ate her. He was very hungry as he hasn't been eating anything for three days. He shut the door, dressed the grandmother's clothes, and got into the bed, waiting for Little Red Riding Hood. She came shortly and knocked at the door.

The wolf, now counterfeiting his voice to sound like an old lady, asked who was there.

Little Red Riding Hood heard the strange voice of the wolf, as she knew her grandmother’s voice was soft and gentle, but since she was ill, she thought this is the reason why her voice is now cold and tough. She answered that it was Little Red Riding Hood and that she brought her a little pot of butter and a cake her mother made.

The wolf softened his voice as much as he could and told her to pull the bobbin and enter inside. The door opened and Little Red Riding Hood entered the house.

Seeing her, the wolf said to her to put things she brought on the stool, and come get into bed with her. The little girl took off her clothes and crawled into bed. She was amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes and said to her that she has really big arms. The wolf said they’re big to better hug her.

Then the little girl said she also has big legs, but the wolf told her it was because she wants to run with her.

The little girl noticed the big ears and eyes also, but the wolf said they’re big to hear her and see her better.

Then Little Red Riding Hood noticed the big teeth, and when she was saying those words, the big bad wolf jumped on her and ate her.

_"Grandmother, what big arms you have!"_

_"All the better to hug you with, my dear."_

_"Grandmother, what big legs you have!"_

_"All the better to run with, my child."_

_"Grandmother, what big ears you have!"_

_"All the better to hear with, my child."_

_"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"_

_"All the better to see with, my child."_

_"Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"_

_"All the better to eat you up with."_

The author finishes the story by telling us that children should never talk to strangers as bad things might happen. There are many types of "wolves" and predators pretending to be polite, sweet, and charming just to hurt little children and such gentle wolves are the most dangerous ones.
